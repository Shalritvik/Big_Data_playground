## ⚡ Overview

Welcome to the **Big Data Playground**\! This repository serves as a centralized hub for my experiments, practice modules, and implementations of large-scale data processing architectures.

Here, I document my journey navigating the **Big Data ecosystem**, focusing on distributed computing, ETL pipelines, and scalable storage solutions. The repository contains a mix of **Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`)** for interactive analysis and **Python scripts (`.py`)** for production-style processing.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools

This playground is built upon the following core technologies:

| Technology | Usage |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Apache Spark** | In-memory cluster computing and data processing (PySpark). |
| **Apache Hadoop** | Distributed storage (HDFS) and MapReduce programming. |
| **Python** | Primary scripting language for data manipulation. |
| **SQL** | Structured querying within Spark SQL environments. |
| **Jupyter/Colab** | Interactive development environments for rapid prototyping. |


*(Note: You can adjust the folder names above to match your actual file organization).*

## 💡 Key Concepts Explored

  * **Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDDs):** Low-level transformations and actions.
  * **Spark SQL & DataFrames:** Optimized structured data processing.
  * **MapReduce Patterns:** Implementing mappers and reducers for efficient data aggregation.
  * **Performance Tuning:** Experimenting with caching, broadcasting variables, and partitioning.
